    """
    Revision 2 : This is a good question to remind why Tries are a good idea over map. It's because creating a substring in python is an O(N) operation.
    I was able to remember the set intersection and trie solution but before any solution I was able to remember the solution with paired prefix and suffix. It took me a while to figure out how they would fit.
    I didn't write the code in this attempt considering it's low frequency.
    The code with suffix#prefix is genius solution which I was not able to remember. There is a similar question I can't remember which now... 471_encode-string-with-shortest-length.
    This included something similar. I have to remember this technique from now on.
